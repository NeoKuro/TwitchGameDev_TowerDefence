---- TO DO ----

-- Refactoring
	-- Separate code into specific classes where makes sense. For instance, Health Code out of Enemy_AI into Health class

	
-- Map Editor
	-- Main Menu stuff

-- 3D 
	-- Sci fi / Space ships etc
	-- ASteroid fields, Mountains on Planets
	-- Space Stations, Laser Stations / Towers

-- Bigger Maps / Camera Panning
-- UI design / assets

-- Elements / Types of attacks
	-- More tower types
-- Sounds		
		
		
-- AI Designer Tool
	- Editor Popup tool
	- Shows all possible options for configuration such as HP, speed, attack power?
	- Can toggle certain behaviours on/off
	

-- Effects 
	-- Death FX of Player
-- Player Avatar (Space ship?) which the camera is linked toggle
	-- Can only build within a certain radius of player (some player character(?) can have larger radii)



----IN PROGRESS-----

	
-- Effects 
	-- Death FX of AI (Particles etc)
	-- Weapon detonate effects



----BUGS----

-- Placing turrets in a triangle around the middle road (with the tip facing East), two of the three turrets don't shoot when expected to, the third mostly does but stops now and then for unknown reason




---- DONE ----

		BUG -- Fixed issue where Cthulu was spawning as regular Minions 
		BUG -- Fixed issue where AI 'unlocked status' was not being correctly updated
		BUG -- On lose, if there are still enemies, the turrets keep on shooting them even though paused
		BUG -- When AI reach the final destination, and they teleport back to the beginning, they keep getting more and more separated
