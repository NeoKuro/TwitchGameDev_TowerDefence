[1-10] 1 = trivial / easy and quick  --- 10 is very hard and will take multiple streams
---- TO DO ----

	
-- Map Editor [7]
	-- Main Menu stuff

-- 3D [8]
	-- 3D Camera
	-- Sci fi / Space ships etc
	-- ASteroid fields, Mountains on Planets
	-- Space Stations, Laser Stations / Towers


-- Bigger Maps / Camera Panning [3]
-- UI design [3]
-- UI Assets 


-- Elements / Types of attacks [5]
	-- More tower types
-- Sounds		
		
		
-- AI Designer Tool [7]	
	- Editor Popup tool
	- Shows all possible options for configuration such as HP, speed, attack power?
	- Can toggle certain behaviours on/off
	

-- Effects [9]
	-- Death FX of Player
		-- Gradually 'cracking' the player's screen to simulate battle damage as the player's health goes down
			(Imagine a 3D tactical display on a table that gets cracked)
		-- On death, explosions. Smashed Screen. Bad stuff!
	-- Death FX of AI (Particles etc)
		-- Sections / portions of a ship (2D) cut up and float away like wreckage and fade out (alpha) after a timer
		-- For 3D, generic wreckage pieces such as girders, beams, hull plating etc that isn't too specific to one design also float away but then shrink and disappear after a timer
			




----IN PROGRESS-----

-- Refactoring [3]
	-- Separate code into specific classes where makes sense. For instance, Health Code out of Enemy_AI into Health class
		--- Tower_AI script
			- DamageAmount Obsolete X
			- Weapons / attacks

			
-- Player Avatar (Space ship?) which the camera is linked toggle [4]
	-- Can only build within a certain radius of player (some player character(?) can have larger radii)


----BUGS----

-- Placing turrets in a triangle around the middle road (with the tip facing East), two of the three turrets don't shoot when expected to, the third mostly does but stops now and then for unknown reason




---- DONE ----
